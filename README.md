# near_smart_contract
This express-course is designed for those who don’t have programming experience and want to make the first steps to learn how to write smart contracts on NEAR blockchain.

Before we actually start to write a code let’s discuss what is a Smart Contract? A “Smart Contract” is simply a program that runs on the NEAR blockchain. It is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the NEAR blockchain. You can think of a smart contract as an account on the NEAR network, which runs as a program. 
Users can interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Once deployed on the blockchain the smart contract can not be changed that’s why you need to carefully check your code and test it before deploying it on the blockchain.

Your first smart contract and deploy it on the NEAR testnet.
